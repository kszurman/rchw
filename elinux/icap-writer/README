Write a partial Xilinx bitfile onto the ICAP device

This is a modification of bitinfo by Dave Sullins. See
 - http://home.earthlink.net/~davesullins/software/bitinfo.html
 - and README.bitinfo

Modified version to strip the header off the bitstream and pipe
the remaining data into /dev/icap0

Requirements:
 - Linux on a Xilinx FPGA with ICAP capabilities (Virtex2,4,5,.., possibly Spartan 6).
 - Linux Kernel mods for ICAP driver by Nicholas Palladino, http://fpgawiki.ce.rit.edu/index.php/Main_Page
