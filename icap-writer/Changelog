2011-11-14, version icap-write, stripheader

Modified original bitinfo to
 - read bitstream, strip off the header and write raw bitstream onto /dev/icap
 - read bitstream, strip off the header and write back to stdout

2002-09-10, version 0.2

Updated the way I parse the bitstream length according to information in the
online FPGA FAQ.  Special thanks to "Stephen from Australia" for setting me
straight.  Started using version numbers.  If you have an unnumbered
version of bitinfo, it is version 0.1 and out of date.
