dsrc

data-sources for the reconfigurable audio processing app.

The ac97 modules contained in this directory are built upon the
ac97 standalone code by Mike Wirthlin. This code comes with XUPV2P
documentation, which can be downloaded from

 - http://www.xilinx.com/univ/xupv2p.html

If you load audio.zip (Audio Design for Micorblaze) and unpack this, you
will find the relevant HDL in:

audio/xupv2pro/mb/v91SysGen/bsp/edk_mb/pcores/opb_ac97_v2_00_a/hdl/vhdl/ 

the missing modules need to be added as source-files in ISE.
