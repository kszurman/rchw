Several modules for a Linux based auto-reconfigurable SoC

dsrc:
   data source. these are source modules for a stream processing chain targeted 
	at audio processing. the main source is a AC'97 driver but several types of
	generators can be used

eval:
   evaluate module output in hardware for artificial evolution. specifically,
	this was intended for measuring the frequency of a given signal which would
   too fast for the PPC to cope with

osc:
   several oscillator modules based on frequency division and inverter-cycles.
   the interface is restricted to connect to standard logic

osc_directout:
	direct output variant of the oscillator circuits described above. direct
	output means, that the oscillator with the reconfigurable partition is
   connected directly to I/O logic, bypassing the static system.
