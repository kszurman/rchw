evolvable hardware sub-project

20110819, oswald berthold, part of diploma thesis on DPR / Linux

the goal here is to get evolutionary methods applied to FPGA
subcircuit design

* the plan is as follows
** implement genetic algorithm in pure python
 - ga1.py: straightforward LUT evolution test
 - ga2.py: re-implement ga1.py with pyevolve

** implement genetic algorithm in DPR/Linux system
  - evolution manager on Embedded Linux
  - genotype to phenotype mapping with RapidSmith via remote
		Linux PC (because of java/ppc)
  - intrinsic fitness evaluation

** implement genetic algorithm with netlists and simulation

with real LUTs with either MyHDL or straight VHDL and evaluate
the result by netlist simulation
